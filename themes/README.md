# Themes

A theme is a folder with a `config.json` and, optionally, a `wallpaper.jpg`. Pushing one changes the
launcher's dock, layout and look on the TV without rebuilding the APK: the launcher reads
`config.json` as an overlay over its built-in `config.xml` the next time it starts.

```bash
TV_HOST=192.168.1.50 tools/theme.sh themes/aurora          # push a theme and restart Home
TV_HOST=192.168.1.50 tools/theme.sh --reset                # back to the built-in config.xml
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools\theme.ps1 -TvHost 192.168.1.50 themes\aurora
```

| Theme | What it does |
|---|---|
| `default/` | The built-in look written out as JSON, as a starting point for your own |
| `aurora/` | A dark aurora wallpaper (teal and violet on navy, darker at the bottom) with a matching background colour |
| `six-columns/` | Six smaller tiles per row and one grid row visible under the dock |

## Keys

Every key is optional; a missing key keeps the value from `config.xml`, an unknown or wrongly typed key
is ignored, and a file that doesn't parse is ignored as a whole, so a theme can never break Home.

| Key | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `dock_apps` | list of package names | The dock row, in order; missing apps are skipped |
| `hidden_apps` | list of package names | Never shown as tiles |
| `live_tv_package`, `live_tv_action` | string | The Live TV app and, if it has no leanback entry, the action to start it with |
| `source_panel_service`, `source_panel_action` | string | The TV's own source panel, for sets with no TvInputManager |
| `input_action` | string | Action sent with an HDMI/AV row's channel URI when nothing handles the standard `VIEW` (XGIMI: `com.xgimi.action.hdmiPlayer`) |
| `columns` | 1 to 8 | Tiles per row; tiles shrink to fit from 5 up |
| `rows_below_dock` | 0 to 3 | Grid rows left visible under the dock |
| `shamsi_date` | bool | Show the Solar Hijri date above the Gregorian one |
| `module_cards` | bool | Look for module cards and ask about them (`true`); `false` turns the feature off |
| `reduced_motion` | bool | Calmer motion for weak GPUs: stiff highlight spring, no tile overshoot, short fades, no entrance replay |
| `vpn_app` | string | App the network pill opens when a VPN is configured; also shows a red "VPN off" badge while no VPN is up |
| `show_home_settings_shortcut` | bool | The "Default home" tile, where the TV has a home picker |
| `background_color` | `#RRGGBB` | Colour behind everything; black by default |
| `wallpaper` | bool | Show `wallpaper.jpg` from the theme folder (`true`), or ignore it (`false`) |
| `dock_band` | bool | The darker rounded band behind the dock row (`true`); `false` puts the dock tiles straight on the wallpaper |
| `wallpaper_folder` | string | Folder of pictures that rotate behind the launcher, e.g. `/sdcard/Wallpapers`; empty turns it off. While it has pictures it replaces `wallpaper.jpg`. A Wallpaper tile in the grid opens a pop-up to pick one |
| `wallpaper_rotate_minutes` | 0 to 1440 | Minutes between changes while Home is open; `0` never rotates. A newly added picture always shows at once |

## Wallpapers

`wallpaper.jpg` is drawn full screen behind the launcher, centre-cropped. Keep it dark, 1920×1080 and
under about 300 KB: the text, the hero name and the dock band are designed for black, and a 1 GB TV
decodes the picture into memory on every Home start. Pictures larger than the screen are downsampled.

## Reduced motion

`"reduced_motion": true` keeps the look but calms the movement: the highlight spring is stiff instead
of bouncing, tiles zoom without overshoot, fades are shorter, and Home does not replay the tile
entrance when you come back to it. Use it on TVs whose GPU cannot keep up; a MediaTek MT5895 on
Android 10 is the known case. The default, `false`, keeps the normal motion.

```json
{ "reduced_motion": true }
```

## Adding a theme

Open a PR with a new folder here, a one-line row in the table above and a screenshot from a real TV
in the PR description. Keep the dock list generic (the big streaming apps) unless the theme is for a
specific TV, and say which TV you tried it on.
